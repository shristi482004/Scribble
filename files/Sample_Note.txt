A personal note:
This is my first backend project, and Scribble is a learning journey as much as it is a tool. I’m continuously improving it as I learn more about backend development, better architecture, and user experience. If you have suggestions, feedback, or ideas on how this can be improved, feel free to leave comments or reach out — I’d genuinely love to learn and make this better.

Write freely. Organize gently. Learn constantly.
